# Dev-Data-Products
This repository has the ui.R and server.R files for the Developing Data Products Course Project.
I created a Shiny application and deployed it on Rstudio's servers.
Second, we should use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application.

The app developed is located at: http://127.0.0.1:7502/  
(Shiny app will not work!!!)

The presentation is available at: http://rpubs.com/Diane29/234714
